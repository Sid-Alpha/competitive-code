    //Using both path compression and union by size ensures that the amortized time per operation
    // is only α(n), which is optimal, where α(n) is the inverse Ackermann function.
    // This function has a value α(n) < 5 for any value of n that can be written in this physical universe,
    // so the disjoint-set operations take place in essentially constant time.
